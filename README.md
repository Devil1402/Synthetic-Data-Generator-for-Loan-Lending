# Synthetic-Data-Generator-for-Loan-Lending
This project generates synthetic data for building a credit risk scoring model, which can be used to predict the likelihood of loan default for applicants. The dataset includes features that capture various aspects of an applicant's financial behavior and loan repayment ability, without relying on personal information like age or marital status.
